# Data Projects
## This repository contains my independent projects that explore data analysis, visualisation, and machine learning.

## Projects

### "project-1": Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
*A machine learning project based on the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.*
- Cleaned and explored the dataset.
- Built, optimised, and evaluated Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
- Achieved an accuracy of 0.83 using the Random Forest model.

### "project-2": Sales Trends and Product Performance Analysis and Prediction with Machine Learning
- Analysed a transactional dataset of online retail through data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and visualisations using Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Conducted product and user behaviour analysis using statistical techniques to uncover patterns and insights.
- Built and optimised a Logistic Regression model, achieving an accuracy of 0.9996.
  
### "project-3": User Churn Prediction with Machine Learning
- Gained insights into user behaviour by conducting data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and A/B testing using Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Developed Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models to predict user churn using a dataset of 15,000 user records.
- Achieved a recall of 71.1% using the Logistic Regression model through hyperparameter tuning and addressing class imbalance.
  
### "project-4": Performance Analysis and Predictive Modelling of Digital Marketing Campaigns with Machine Learning
- Cleaned data, performed exploratory data analysis, and created visualisations using Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Identified key drivers of orders, return on marketing investment, and revenue through feature engineering and A/B testing.
- Built and optimised a Random Forest model to predict the number of orders generated from marketing campaigns.
- Achieved an R-squared of 0.92 for the modelâ€™s predictions.
